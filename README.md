# Nifty-50-Portfolio-Construction.
This is a Capstone project "CONSTRUCTING AN  OPTIMAL PORTFOLIO USING SHARPE'S SINGLE INDEX MODEL  WITH SPECIAL REFERENCED TO NIFTY -50" which I did in my final year of collage (MS EXCEL).

# Portfolio Construction :

- **Project objective:** 

    **1.** Create a _[Ranking report for sharpe single index](https://github.com/KirandeepMarala/Excel-Sales_Analysis/blob/main/Customer%20Performance%20Report.pdf)_ where only top 10 stocks are taken into consideration.

    **2.** Using the ranking report, find the _[Cutoff rate.](https://github.com/KirandeepMarala/Excel-Sales_Analysis/blob/main/Customer%20Performance%20Report.pdf)_
  
    **3.** To find _[Xi-proportion of each stock.](https://github.com/KirandeepMarala/Excel-Sales_Analysis/blob/main/Customer%20Performance%20Report.pdf)_ using Beta and Cutoff rate.

    **4.** With systematic and unsystematic risks find the _[Total risk.](https://github.com/KirandeepMarala/Excel-Sales_Analysis/blob/main/Customer%20Performance%20Report.pdf)_

    **5.** With Mean return and Xi find the _[Total Portfolio return.](https://github.com/KirandeepMarala/Excel-Sales_Analysis/blob/main/Customer%20Performance%20Report.pdf)_
