# Nifty-50-Portfolio-Construction.
This is a Capstone project "CONSTRUCTING AN  OPTIMAL PORTFOLIO USING SHARPE'S SINGLE INDEX MODEL  WITH SPECIAL REFERENCED TO NIFTY -50" which I did in my final year of collage (MS EXCEL).

# Portfolio Construction :

- **Project objective:** 

    **1.** Create a _[Ranking report for sharpe single index](https://github.com/sreevignesh05/Nifty-50-Portfolio-Construction./blob/main/Ranking%20of%20sharpe%20single%20index.pdf)_ where only top 10 stocks are taken into consideration.

    **2.** Using the ranking report, find the _[Cutoff rate.](https://github.com/KirandeepMarala/Excel-Sales_Analysis/blob/main/Customer%20Performance%20Report.pdf)_
  
    **3.** To find _[Xi-proportion of each stock.](https://github.com/KirandeepMarala/Excel-Sales_Analysis/blob/main/Customer%20Performance%20Report.pdf)_ using Beta and Cutoff rate.

    **4.** With systematic and unsystematic risks find the _[Total risk.](https://github.com/KirandeepMarala/Excel-Sales_Analysis/blob/main/Customer%20Performance%20Report.pdf)_

    **5.** With Mean return and Xi find the _[Total Portfolio return.](https://github.com/KirandeepMarala/Excel-Sales_Analysis/blob/main/Customer%20Performance%20Report.pdf)_

- **Purpose of portfolio construction:**

1. To highlight the Theoretical Background of Sharpe’s Single Index Model.
2. To analyze the Risk and Returns of NSE Nifty 50 Securities.
3. To construct Optimal Portfolio of Selected Securities Using Sharpe’s
Single Index Model.
4. To determine the Proportional Investment to be made in each Selected 
Securities.
5. To study the relative market performance for the company’s constituent 
to NIFTY 50 Index for the last 5 years.
6. Construction of an optimal portfolio empirically using the Sharpe’s Single 
Index Model.
7. Determine the proportion of investment to be made in each of the selected 
stocks.
8. Identify the risk and return of the portfolio hence built.

- **Importance of Portfolio:**
“Stock market is an ocean, where dealing in stock market is just sailing in a ship without a compass”. Investing one’s hard earned money is indeed an onerous task as one has to make a prudent decision by taking several factors into account. There may be a wide variety of investment avenues available in today’s investment world but the reliability of each one of them is quite uncertain. This uncertainty is termed risk in finance parlance. All investors invest in multiple securities, rather than one security, there must be some benefits in investing in a portfolio of securities that is risk in the portfolio securities are diversified. The investment in several securities reduced the risk of the investment. The appropriate selection of securities can assure good return to investors and can also help to reduce the losses. Many studies have been conducted to construct portfolio and analyze its performance in the stock markets world wide including India. Especially they have conducted in BSE 100 index and NSE Nifty and Nifty junior indices. There was very few study undertaken to construct portfolio for NSE Nifty 50 companies sector wise. Thus, the present study is an attempt to analyze the risk and return of the companies sector wise listed in NSE Nifty 50 index for constructing an optimum portfolio and evaluate the performance of the sectors to offer investment option to investors.

- **SCOPE OF THE STUDY:**
1. The further study can be build in all other index.
2. The researcher can make a study in other stock Exchanges.
3. The upcoming researchers can also extend their study to the global markets.
4. The forthcoming examiner may extend the study period of the research.
